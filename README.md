# Time Flies Straight, by Mr Speaker

[Time Flies Straight](http://www.mrspeaker.net/dev/ld27): A game made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare #27 on the theme "10 seconds".

I had a lot of ideas I tried to jam in at the last second. As a result, the code turned a bit... wobbly like the game. I intend to clean it up at some point. If you're reading this text, then that has not happened.

## Notes to self: move this back to Ω

Ω is the library I started a couple of Ludum Dares ago and contains
things I reuse over the games.

- utils: rad2Deg, deg2Rad
- mabye move input.bind to an object, instead of array of arrays
- lerpperc
- raycast map - after A LOT of refactoring
- wasdown not working in dialogs
- set up basic grunt for jams!
- cb on dialogs?
